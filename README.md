# Using this Repository 
Before continuing, you can clone this repository from Github using this link
    `git clone https://github.com/UW-MLGEO/MLGEO24_katherinem.git`

This subsequent coding scripts are created and devloped using Python in Visual Studio Code and require several packages including Numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, and os. Before running these scripts, please install these necessary packages by first creating an environment in the terminal. 
    `conda create --name myenv python=3.9 (or replace with desired python version)`
Then, activate the environment in the terminal each time you need to use it
    `conda activate myenv`
You can then install any packages you need to run these scripts (Numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, and os)
    `conda install anaconda::numpy`
    `conda install conda-forge::matplotlib`
Now you can run any scripts available in this repository. 

# Exciting Earth Science Topics

I generally work with cloud-aerosol interactions over the ocean, but really am interested in anything, especially if it is something new. Some topics I would love to know more about are plate tectonics and earthqaukes, volcanology, water resources, marine biology, and ecology. 

# Choice of Licensing

I chose the MIT license mostly because the professor has this license and I figured this would be a good way to trial and error a license before commiting to a different version.
